A theme for `pelican` inspired by `notmyidea-cms`.
Basically a lot of stuff that I do not need is removed, some style is doneâ€¦

Translations are done with the plugin `i18n_subsites`.

Pages are sorted by attribute `position`; if it is 0, then the page is hidden.

MathJax is directly included in the theme templates, and math is sans-serif.
